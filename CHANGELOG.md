## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Structured workout model v2**: pace range (min/max), HR range (bpm), repeat blocks, rest blocks, open duration support in `coaching_workout_blocks`
- **`.FIT` file generation**: Edge Function `generate-fit-workout` produces binary `.FIT` workout files (protocol 2.0, CRC-16 validated) for direct-to-watch delivery
- **"Enviar para relógio" button**: Athletes with FIT-compatible watches (Garmin, COROS, Suunto) can share `.FIT` files via native share sheet
- **Athlete-centric workout assignment page** (`/workouts/assign`): lists all athletes with watch compatibility badges, bulk assignment (select N athletes + template + date), inline watch type editing
- **Watch type tracking**: `watch_type` column on `coaching_members` with auto-detection from `coaching_device_links` via `v_athlete_watch_type` view; `fn_set_athlete_watch_type` RPC for coach override
- **Assignment → auto-attendance bridge**: `trg_assignment_to_training` trigger auto-creates `coaching_training_sessions` with distance/pace from workout blocks when assignments are created
- Portal workout template detail page (`/workouts/[id]`) with structured block visualization
- Portal templates list now shows total distance and links to detail view
- API routes: `POST /api/workouts/assign` (bulk), `POST /api/workouts/watch-type`
- FIT validation tools (`tools/test_fit_generation.js`, `tools/validate_fit.js`)
- 46 new tests: WorkoutBlockEntity v2 fields, WorkoutBlockType enum (rest/repeat), labels, repo mapper, watch type resolution, FIT compatibility
- RLS policies for athlete read access to workout blocks and templates

### Changed
- `WorkoutBlockEntity`: replaced single `targetPaceSecondsPerKm` with `targetPaceMinSecPerKm`/`targetPaceMaxSecPerKm` range; added `targetHrMin`/`targetHrMax`, `repeatCount`, `notes`
- Workout builder UI: expanded bottom sheet with pace range, HR range, repeat count, notes, rest/repeat block types
- Portal sidebar: "Treinos" renamed to "Templates", added "Atribuir Treinos" entry
- Conditional "Enviar para relógio": hidden for Apple Watch/Polar users, shows guidance text instead

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Auto-attendance system** replacing QR-based check-in for training sessions
  - Staff assigns workouts with distance target and optional pace range
  - System automatically evaluates athlete's next 2 runs against training parameters
  - Distance match (±15%) + pace match → Concluído; ran but no match → Parcial; no runs → Ausente

- CRM labels: "Presenças" → "Treinos", attendance counts → "treinos concluídos"

- Premium dark mode design system applied to all 88 Flutter screens and portal pages
- Dark mode readability fixes: theme-aware colors for Strava banners, challenge cards, matchmaking, badge cards
- AppBar backgrounds: removed all `inversePrimary` overrides across 24+ screens for proper dark mode contrast
- "Progresso" hub: removed competition sub-tabs and OmniCoins section for cleaner layout
- "Primeiros passos" card made collapsible; runner quiz only shown after first steps complete
- Strava connection status now refreshes when dashboard tab becomes visible

- Fixed `staff-alerts` API route: `settlements` → `clearing_cases`, `created_at_ms` → `created_at`

### Fixed
